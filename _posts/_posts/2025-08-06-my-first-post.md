In the world of software and web applications, the terms "client" and "server" are used frequently. They are key components of how information is delivered across networks like the internet. Let’s break down what each of these means and how they work together.

💻 What is a Client?
A client is any device or application that sends a request to another device or application to get some data or service. It could be:

A web browser like Chrome or Firefox

A mobile app like Instagram or WhatsApp

A computer accessing a network file

Clients interact with servers by sending requests and receiving responses.

🖥️ What is a Server?
A server is a powerful computer or software that stores data, applications, and services. It responds to requests made by clients. Examples include:

A web server hosting websites

A mail server delivering emails

A file server storing documents

Servers are always running and ready to provide services to many clients at once.

⚙️ How Do They Work Together?
A user opens a browser and types a website URL (client action).

The browser sends a request to the server where the website is hosted.

The server processes the request and sends back the necessary data (like HTML, CSS, images).

The browser displays the website to the user.

This process happens in milliseconds!

📌 Real-World Example
You open www.google.com in your browser (client).

Your browser sends a request to Google’s server.

The server sends back the search page, and you can start typing your query.
